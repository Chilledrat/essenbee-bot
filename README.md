# essenbee-bot
A self-teaching project to build a Bot, initially integrating with Slack.

- 2019-02-08: Added Twitch support. The bot is now used on my Codebase Alpha Twitch stream
- 2019-04-12: Added Discord support.

Commands supported:

- [X] !help _cmd_      - List commands available or if _cmd_ supplied, information about that command
- [X] !news _topic_    - Top news items, either general headlines or on the supplied _topic_
- [X] !launches _arg_  - Upcoming rocket launches (argument indicates launch provider; default is 'spacex')
- [X] !cricket         - Cricket scores from around the world
- [X] !ask _question_  - Ask any question and the bot will use Cognitive Services to answer it (or try)
- [X] !adv             - An implementation of the classic text adventure game _Adventure_ - a work in progress (its big)
- [X] !hey             - Essenbee can get engrossed in the code, so attract their attention with this SFX command (Twitch chat only)
  
More commands planned.
